 * 
 * ## Examples
 * 
 * ``` # use cosmwasm_std::Timestamp; let ts = Timestamp::from_nanos(1_000_000_202); assert_eq!(ts.nanos(), 1_000_000_202); assert_eq!(ts.seconds(), 1); assert_eq!(ts.subsec_nanos(), 202);
 * 
 * let ts = ts.plus_seconds(2); assert_eq!(ts.nanos(), 3_000_000_202); assert_eq!(ts.seconds(), 3); assert_eq!(ts.subsec_nanos(), 202); ```

/**
 * A thin wrapper around u64 that is using strings for JSON encoding/decoding, such that the full u64 range can be used for clients that convert JSON numbers to floats, like JavaScript and jq.
 * 
 * # Examples
 * 
 * Use `from` to create instances of this and `u64` to get the value out:
 * 
 * ``` # use cosmwasm_std::Uint64; let a = Uint64::from(42u64); assert_eq!(a.u64(), 42);
 * 
 * let b = Uint64::from(70u32); assert_eq!(b.u64(), 70); ```

/**
 * A human readable address.
 * 
 * In Cosmos, this is typically bech32 encoded. But for multi-chain smart contracts no assumptions should be made other than being UTF-8 encoded and of reasonable length.
 * 
 * This type represents a validated address. It can be created in the following ways 1. Use `Addr::unchecked(input)` 2. Use `let checked: Addr = deps.api.addr_validate(input)?` 3. Use `let checked: Addr = deps.api.addr_humanize(canonical_addr)?` 4. Deserialize from JSON. This must only be done from JSON that was validated before such as a contract's state. `Addr` must not be used in messages sent by the user because this would result in unvalidated instances.
 * 
 * This type is immutable. If you really need to mutate it (Really? Are you sure?), create a mutable copy using `let mut mutable = Addr::to_string()` and operate on that `String` instance.
